## Features

### âœ… Authentication Flow

* `register/page.tsx`: Allows new users to register (name, email, password), stored in `localStorage`
* `login/page.tsx`: Authenticates based on saved credentials and redirects to `/dashboard`
* `dashboard/page.tsx`: Only accessible if logged in
* `app/page.tsx`: Root route redirects to `/login` or `/dashboard` based on auth state

### âœ… State Management

* Zustand is used for simple auth state:
  * `isAuthenticated` state
  * `login()` and `logout()` actions

### âœ… UI/UX

* Fully responsive login & register pages
* Swipeable testimonial panel with `react-swipeable`
* Toast notifications using `react-toastify`
* Styled using Tailwind CSS, including gradients, transitions, and responsiveness

### âœ… Error Handling

* Form validations with toast alerts
* Auto-clearing error messages
* Navigation protection and redirection
